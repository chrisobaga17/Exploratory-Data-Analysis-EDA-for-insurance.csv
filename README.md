The dataset used for analysis contains information on the medical charges billed by health insurance companies for individuals based on their demographic and personal attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
The dataset has 1338 observations and 7 columns. The columns are age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and charges. There are no missing values in the dataset. The age ranges from 18 to 64 with a mean of 39 years. The BMI ranges from 15.96 to 53.13 with a mean of 30.66. The number of children ranges from 0 to 5 with a mean of 1.09. The charges range from 1121.87 to 63770.43 with a mean of 13270.42.
There are two unique values for sex: male and female. There are four unique regions: northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. The smoker column has two unique values: yes and no. The number of unique values for children is six.
The data has been sorted by age and grouped by gender and whether or not the individual has children. It was found that there are more males than females in the dataset, with 676 males and 662 females. The number of people with children is slightly higher than those without children.
From the histogram, it can be seen that the distribution of age, BMI, and charges is positively skewed, indicating that there are more people with lower age, BMI, and charges. There is no strong correlation between any two variables.
Overall, the dataset provides useful information for understanding the factors that influence medical charges billed by insurance companies. Further analysis can be carried out to identify patterns or relationships between the variables that affect medical charges.
